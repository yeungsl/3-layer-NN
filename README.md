# 3-layer-NN
Little project to implement simple Markov chain based Clssifier, who classifies the poinst input to train it. Implemented in python.

# Usage
The input file should be a data set of points (a file with x and y values) and a corresponding file to differentiat the values
Then the network will Output a Graph with points bounded with the same color.

# Examples
Also the user can modify the hidden layer dimention(the number of nodes in hidden layer) and the learning rate.
Two data sets used in exmaples are linear and moon and Hidden dimention is 5.
* linear
* moon
